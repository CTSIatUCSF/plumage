{"body":"# About Plumage\r\n\r\n## What is Plumage?\r\n\r\nPlumage is free software to make biomedical resources at large\r\ninstitutions more discoverable. It was developed at the University of\r\nCalifornia, San Francisco, to power [UCSF Cores Search], the\r\ncampus-wide search engine for core resources.\r\n\r\n## Why Plumage?\r\n\r\nDesigned to maximize resource discoverability:\r\n\r\n* typeahead search available on every page\r\n* users can browse through a complete A-Z index of options, including synonyms\r\n\r\nCarefully optimized for search engine users:\r\n\r\n* every synonym for every concept has its own page\r\n* page titles tunes to meet needs of searchers\r\n* pages include semantic data in microformats\r\n\r\nEasy to deploy:\r\n\r\n* pulls data from an eagle-i instance, or from a compatible data source (e.g. CSV file with Eagle-I ontology mappings)\r\n* generates a static site, compatible with all web servers on all platforms\r\n\r\n## Who is Plumage?\r\n\r\nThe Plumage software was developed by Anirvan Chatterjee and the\r\nVirtual Home team at the [Clinical & Translational Science\r\nInstitute][CTSI] at the University of California, San Francisco, in\r\ncollaboration with UCSF's [Research Resources Program][RRP].\r\n\r\nThis project was supported by the National Center for Research\r\nResources and the National Center for Advancing Translational\r\nSciences, National Institutes of Health, through UCSF-CTSI Grant\r\nNumber UL1 RR024131. Its contents are solely the responsibility of the\r\nauthors and do not necessarily represent the official views of the\r\nNIH.\r\n\r\n## Learn more\r\n\r\n* [UCSF Cores Search 2.0: Design Strategy Overview](slides) (Slideshare presentation)\r\n\r\n## License Information\r\n\r\nPlumage is Copyright (c) 2012, The Regents of the University of\r\nCalifornia.

It extracts data from an instance of eagle-i (or data\r\nmarked up with the eagle-i ontology), and generates a new web site --\r\nstatic HTML, JavaScript, and images that can be deployed on any\r\nserver.\r\n\r\nThe software is bundled with a standard set of web templates created\r\nwith Template Toolkit incorporating cores discoverability best\r\npractices originally implemented at UCSF. Generated website can be\r\neasily customized in two ways:\r\n\r\n* Basic changes (e.g. to the name of the generated website) can be\r\n  made in the plumage.conf configuration file.\r\n\r\n* Many look and feel changes can be made by adding custom header and\r\n  footer HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, to enhance or override the base\r\n  templates. These customizations are stored in a way that allows for\r\n  easy upgrades of the base templates.\r\n\r\n## Quick start\r\n\r\nEnsure you have Perl 5.12 or higher installed on your server. Perl\r\n5.12+ is installed on virtually all current Unix-like distributions,\r\nincluding MacOS 10.7 and higher. If you're unable to upgrade an older\r\nversion of Perl bundled with your system, use [Perlbrew] to install a\r\nnewer version of Perl. Plumage may work on Windows, but hasn't been\r\ntested.\r\n\r\nDownload a tarball or ZIP file of Plumage from Github. Unarchive it.\r\n\r\nInstall Plumage and its Perl dependencies. You may be prompted to\r\nconfigure [CPAN] settings; if so, just follow the instructions, and\r\nstick with the default options.\r\n\r\n    perl Build.PL\r\n    ./Build installdeps\r\n\r\nThen try running the Plumage app.\r\n\r\n    ./bin/plumage\r\n\r\nIf you see a help screen, everything worked.\r\n\r\nNow we're going to configure the simplest possible configuration. Use\r\na text editor to create a file called `plumage.conf` in your current\r\ndirectory with the following contents. (We're using Howard University\r\nas an example.)\r\n\r\n    site_name              = Howard Cores Search\r\n    institution_short_name = Howard\r\n    eagle_i_base_url       = http://howard.eagle-i.net/\r\n    output_path            = /var/www/html/plumage_example\r\n    url                    = http://localhost/plumage_example/\r\n\r\nHere's how to set the configuration options:\r\n\r\n* Set `site_name` to the name of the website you're creating.\r\n\r\n* Set `institution_short_name` to however your users refer to your\r\n  institution when running searches, e.g UCSF, Howard OHSU.\r\n\r\n* Set `eagle_i_base_url` to the root URL of your eagle-i\r\n  installation. If it's password protected, put the username and\r\n  password in the URL, e.g\r\n  `http://username:password@youreagle-i.server.url/`.\r\n\r\n* The `output_path` is the place on disk where the new website will be\r\n  written. **Create a new directory**, and enter the path here;\r\n  Plumage will not run if this directory doesn't exist. *NOTE: Plumage\r\n  will delete the contents of this directory** every time it runs.\r\n\r\n* Set `url` to the URL where this website will be viewed. If you have\r\n  a local web server, you might use an `http://localhost/` URL. If you\r\n  don't, you can use a `file://` URL that corresponds with your\r\n  `output_path`; if your `output_path` is `/tmp/plumage-test` you can\r\n  set your URL to ``file:///tmp/plumage-test/`.\r\n\r\nDone? Let's build the website:\r\n\r\n    ./bin/plumage --build\r\n\r\nYou should see messages showing the website being built.\r\n\r\nPay attention to error messages. Still having problems? Feel free to\r\ncontact Anirvan (anirvan.chatterjee at ucsf.edu) with your questions.\r\n\r\n## Real World Usage\r\n\r\n*to be written*\r\n\r\n## Configuation Details\r\n\r\n*to be written*\r\n\r\n`institution_short_name` to the most colloqial way your users refer to\r\nyour institution when running searches. For example, most users at the\r\nUniversity of California, San Francisco will write \"UCSF\" and are\r\nlikely to run web searches for things like \"ucsf nmr\".\r\n\r\n`eagle_i_base_url` is the root URL of your eagle-i installation. If\r\nyour installation is centrally hosted, it might look like\r\n`http://yourname.eagle-i.net/`. If it's password protected, you can\r\nput the authentication details in the URL, e.g\r\n`http://username:password@youreagle-i.server.url/`.\r\n\r\n`output_path` is the place on disk where the new website will be\r\nwritten. Create a new directory, and enter the path here; Plumage\r\nbuilds will not run if this directory does not exist. **The contents\r\nof this directory will be overwritten on every build.**\r\n\r\n`url` is the URL where the generated website will be viewed. If you\r\nhave a local web server, you might use an `http://localhost/` URL. If\r\nyou don't, you can use a `file://` URL that corresponds with your\r\n`output_path`; if your `output_path` is `/tmp/plumage-test` you can\r\nset your URL to ``file:///tmp/plumage-test/`.\r\n\r\n\r\n[UCSF Cores Search]: http://cores.ucsf.edu/\r\n[CTSI]: http://ctsi.ucsf.edu/\r\n[RRP]: http://rrp.ucsf.edu/\r\n[slides]: http://www.slideshare.net/CTSIatUCSF/ucsf-cores-search-20-design-strategy-overview\r\n[TLDRLegal]: http://www.tldrlegal.com/license/bsd-3-clause-license-(revised)\r\n[Twitter Bootstrap]: http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/\r\n[Placeholders.js]: https://github.com/jamesallardice/Placeholders.js\r\n[Resize Events]: http://irama.org/web/dhtml/resize-events/\r\n[jQuery]: http://jquery.com/\r\n[Apache 2.0 license]: http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\r\n[GPL]: http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html\r\n[MIT license]: http://opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php\r\n[Perlbrew]: https://github.com/gugod/App-perlbrew/\r\n[CPAN]: http://www.cpan.org/\r\n","tagline":"Biomedical resource discovery for institutions, powered by eagle-i","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
