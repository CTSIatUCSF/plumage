* Plumage builds now queries Eagle-I directly, instead of requiring an
  intermediary JSON representation. "eagle_i_base_url" configuration
  option now highly recommended ("resource_listings_file_path" is now
  optional).

* plumage command line app now requires a "--build" option to build a
  site (and a "--dump" option to dump JSON Eagle-I data, if needed)

* Entire platform now has unified logging and debug messages via
  Log4perl. Use "plumage -v" for verbose output (default), "-q" for
  quiet mode (errors only), or "-d" for extra debugging output.

* When looking for a configuration file, software now also looks in
  the plumage excutable file's directory.

* Added support for deploy_command configuration option, allowing for
  a command line to get called after every build.

* Added support for "institution_short_name" config option, e.g.
  "UCSF" or "OHSU".

* Added support for "search_placeholder" config option, e.g. "e.g.
  flow cytometer".

* Add support for automatic role-based configurations, e.g. for
  development or production builds.
