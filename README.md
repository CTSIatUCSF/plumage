# Plumage

Biomedical resource discovery for institutions, powered by Eagle-I

## What is Plumage?

Plumage is free software to make biomedical resources at large
institutions more discoverable. It was developed at the University of
California, San Francisco, to power [UCSF Cores Search][], the
campus-wide search engine for core resources.

## Why Plumage?

Designed to maximize resource discoverability:

* typeahead search available on every page
* users can browse through a complete A-Z index of options, including synonyms

Carefully optimized for search engine users:

* every synonym for every concept has its own page
* page titles tunes to meet needs of searchers
* pages include semantic data in microformats

Easy to deploy:

* pulls data from an eagle-i instance, or from a compatible data source (e.g. CSV file with Eagle-I ontology mappings)
* generates a static site, compatible with all web servers on all platforms

## Who is Plumage?

The Plumage software was developed by Anirvan Chatterjee and the
Virtual Home team at the [Clinical & Translational Science
Institute][CTSI] at the University of California, San Francisco, in
collaboration with UCSF's [Research Resources Program][RRP].

This project was supported by the National Center for Research
Resources and the National Center for Advancing Translational
Sciences, National Institutes of Health, through UCSF-CTSI Grant
Number UL1 RR024131. Its contents are solely the responsibility of the
